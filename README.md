# twitter stuff

The code gathers geographical data of Twitter users who made posts with #corona, #covid19 in a select time period and writes it to a CSV file, along with the time it was posted and the contents of the tweet.

To get a consumer API key and secret: apply for a developer account on Twitter (takes about a week for them to respond, be patient).

Once that's done, you'll be able to create an app on Twitter, which in turn will give you the access token and secret. Copy all those into the Python file.
